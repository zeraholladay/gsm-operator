                  Each condition has a unique type and reflects the status of a specific aspect of the resource.

                  Standard condition types include:
                  - "Ready": the Secret has been successfully materialized.
                  - "Progressing": the Secret is being created or updated.
                  - "Degraded": the controller failed to reach or maintain the desired state.

                  The status of each condition is one of True, False, or Unknown.
